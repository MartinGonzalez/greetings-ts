# Greetings Typescript Learning

This project serves as a learning platform for exploring the features of TypeScript. It is a test project designed to provide hands-on experience with TypeScript's static typing, interfaces, classes, and other unique features.

In addition to being a learning platform, this project also serves as a practical example of how to structure TypeScript code in a more interactive and layered manner. It demonstrates how to separate core business logic from infrastructure concerns, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. This project is not only about learning TypeScript, but also about understanding good software architecture practices.
